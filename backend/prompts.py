        * **Usage:** Input a base URL to crawl, specifying parameters such as `max_depth`, `max_breadth`, and `extract_depth`.
        * **Best Practices:**

            * Begin with shallow crawls and progressively increase depth.
            * Utilize `select_paths` or `exclude_paths` to focus the crawl.
